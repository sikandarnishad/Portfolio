											<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Sikandar<br />
											as a Data Science Engineer</h1>

Ever since I was a little kid, Software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in a front of my computer, with the basic things loaded in ,making it print and then when I try to make a change on it "Hello, world" to "Hello, Sikandar" for the first time. so it was almost like a magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing a key. And then I learned C,C++,java, python and so on through books.
This passion carried me through my education at Thakur college of engineering and technology.
Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied a new languages, algorithm, higher mathematics. And it was here that i learned truly how much there was yet to learn.
So, now, in industry , this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn , yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this ,I am very grateful.
